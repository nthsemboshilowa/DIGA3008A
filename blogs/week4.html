                <h3> Goal Alignment</h3>
            
            <p>
                The primary goal of this website is to explore how seamless and simplistic design can create a user-friendly experience through the heavy influence of interactive and responsive elements. The website aims to engage users while exhibiting a simple yet pleasing aesthetic. By engaging with the website, the user will also gain sense of my personality and portfolio work. <br>
            
            My original wireframes did not include a navigation bar. This means that the user will be able to enter each content page, but won't have a way of navigating to other pages. By including the nav bar in my wireframes, I extend the accessibility of my design and allow a proper flow between each of the content pages. <br>
            
            <h3>URL Folder Structure</h3>
            <img class="u-photo" src="../images/InformationStructure.png" alt="URL structure map" title="URL Structure"/>
            
            <h3> User Flow</h3>
            <img class="u-photo" src="../images/UserFlow.png" alt="Map of user flow" title="User Flow"/> <br>
            
            <br>The website design needs to adhere to a design structure that allows for a good user experience. Making the navigation seamless and easy between content pages will facilitate this aspect. The user needs to be able to navigate between pages when interacting with the website so this is an important step in the design process.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3> Design Template</h3>
            
            <p>
                The website will be using CSS and JavaScript to help with the visual design aspects of the website. These visual design elements will help create a pleasing and aesthetic look. By using the interface as a medium of communication that will also communicate to he user how they can manipulate the system through these user interactions
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3> Style Guide</h3>
            <p>
                The readability, font, colour palette, background and layout are all elements are considered when thinking about how you want you user to interact with your website. The main focus would would be:<br>
            
            <br>"What do you want you user to see first?", "What are things you want them to experience?", "What kind of feeling does your website give the user?". <br>
            
            <br> The design should promote user engagement and not take it away. Having a page that overwhelms the user would take away from the goal I'm trying to achieve. The style guide then acts to reiterate the importance of the feel and flow of the website. It is like a trailer of what the website is going to look like. It gives an idea of how the elements will be structured on the pages, how it promotes the content on each page while catering to the target audience.

            <h3> Website 1 Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                The initial we design process seemed easy and simple since I use different websites all the time and have noted all the things that I would consider and include in my own website. Now that I have started my own, I realised that although I want to include and consider all of these design ideas, it isn't as intuitive as I expected it to be. I realised how important each process is in web design. Learning html has been fun and through this process, I have garnered new knowledge on web design. <br>
            
                <br>I faced challenges with website navigation which stems back to my: folder structure. I have change the format of my folder structure and have re-evaluated how I want my website to flow. This will fundamentally change the user flow and design elements of my website. My focus now is how I will structure the UI and UX elements to compliment and support the URL Structure and improve the user experience overall. I'm glad I was able to find an efficient way to build this website. It has really made things easier for me.<br>
            
                <br>I also cannot wait to use Java Script and CSS to start adding the visual elements and really bring my website to life. I am a bit anxious about the coding elements but I have found that working week-by-week has made things easier.
            
                <br>I am most proud of the structure of my website. It flows the way I expected it to and has all the elements that I would like to see in a website such as a consistent format, font and layout. Once I added the Navbar, the goals for my user flow that I tried to achieve were met. My website is being iterated every chance I get will continue to improve.<br>
