                    In web design, user alignment refers to how the design of your website aligns with the user's expectations, experience, needs and behaviours when interacting with a website.  My user alignment aims to consider elements that are placed in a format that is intuitive to the user. <br>
                    
                    
                    <br> The ways I intend to do this is to prioritise user-centered design to improve usability and engagement. To do this, establishing a consistent structure that focuses on readability, simplicity and interactivity in order to create a seamless experience that will keep the user engaged. </br>
                    
                    <br> Content:
                    <ul><b>
                        <li> Homepage</li>
                        <li> Blogs</li>
                        <li> Portfolio</li>
                        <li> Profile</li>
                        <li> Essays</li>
                    
                    </b>
                    </ul>
                    
                    The user interface aims to convey a simplistic design that is accessible and responsive. Any and all screen readers (desktop, phone, tablet) should be able to engage with the website content, emulating similar if not the same experience across platforms. I aim to utilise other semantic languages such as Javascript and CSS once I have establish a front-end scheme that satisfies the requirements of a working design.<br>
                    
                    <br> Javascript and CSS as mentioned above work as back-end semantic languages that aid in the visual formatting and layout placement in web design and primarily focus on bridging the gap between the user and the system.
                        </p>
                    
                    <h3> URL Scheme and Semantic Markup</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        The use of HTML (or other markup languages) that communicates the meaning of content instead of primarily specifying how it is presented is known as semantic markup. <br>
                        It aids in the comprehension of the content's structure and intent by screen readers, search engines, and other technologies. <br>
                        <br>
                    
                        <img
                        class="u-photo" src="../images/URL Scheme.png" width="900" height="900" alt="URL Scheme" title="URL Scheme"/>
                    <br> Better understanding the <b>folder structure</b> allows for my content to be structured in a way that aligns with how I want my URL Scheme and Sematic Markup to function.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3> Development progress</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        The have been updated my website weekly to ensure that I am up to date. I have noticed that regularly updating my website allows me time to familiarise myself with the semantic elements and web design. There are many small considerations that one has to make when design the user interface and user experience. <br>
                        Many attributes of design may seem intuitive at first, but when applying these principals into a practical example I realised things like navigation and structure or interaction and engagement matter just as much as the aesthetics. I have therefore been focusing on learning the semantic HTML elements to better structure and understand the purpose of my content.
