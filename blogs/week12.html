              <h3>What is my website and code doing differently?</h3>

              <p>
                For me, building this website has been about more than just design—it's been about creating something that feels true to how I think and work. I’ve moved away from standard, polished web templates and leaned into something more personal: a site that feels like a sketchbook, with dotted backgrounds, sticky-note content cards, and space to draw and play. These choices aren’t just aesthetic—they’re a way of pushing back against rigid, corporate web design norms and making room for creativity, messiness, and expression. By writing my own JavaScript and focusing on accessibility, I’m also trying to build something that’s lightweight, inclusive, and reflective of how I want the web to work—not just for me, but for others too. In my own way, I see this as part of decolonising code—reclaiming space, voice, and the freedom to create differently.

              <h3>Development Process</h3>
              <p>
                I have been using JavaScript primarily to enhance the visual and interactive aspects of my website. One notable feature is the ability to draw in the background, adding a playful and personalised touch to the browsing experience. 
                
                JavaScript also drives the smooth animations and transitions between pages, which help create a more cohesive and immersive journey for users as they explore different sections of the site. These elements not only improve aesthetics but also reduce visual friction, making the experience feel faster and more intuitive.</p>
                
                <p>Moving forward, I plan to use JavaScript to improve functionality and streamline my codebase by developing reusable components. My goal is to build a website that feels both unique and efficient, while continuing to explore JavaScript’s wide range of capabilities. It's a powerful language that supports creative interaction design and is a valuable skill I’m actively developing.

              <p>
                My website is designed to feel like a personalised notebook or sketchbook. This theme influenced several visual choices, such as the dotted background and the use of sticky notes for some of the content cards. These design elements aim to evoke a sense of creativity and informality, reflecting how ideas often begin—sketched, scribbled, and pinned down. To deepen this aesthetic, I plan to incorporate more scribble-like features, including the ability to draw directly in the background and animated scribble effects that add movement and personality. </p>
                
                <p>Additional background animations may also be introduced to enhance this dynamic, hand-drawn atmosphere. Elements like content cards will continue to mimic sticky notes, and other notebook-inspired features such as rough sketches and handwritten-style visuals will be layered throughout the site. This approach supports my goal of making the site not just interactive, but expressive—blurring the line between digital space and creative workspace.
