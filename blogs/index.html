<h3>
Your experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages
</h3>

<p>
I am familiar with the GitHub interface and know my way around most of the features but it was my first time publishing to Pages. It was a lot easier than I anticipated. Although we've just started, I'm excited to develop this website and see what happens in this course. 
</p> 


<h3>
    Reflection on the readings you selected - relating it to your experience with the internet today
</h3>


<p>
Harper - 2010 - 'As We May Think' 

After reading this article, I better understand the internet as being a digitalized mind. The structures and framework in which these systems are developed are like an person's mind; while the internet acts like a hive mind intended to link all the intersection that take place. We can observed many similarities between the how our own minds work and how the internet works; blurring the lines between reality and pixels.

There really is more to it than meets the eye, which makes learning about intimidating and overwhelming. The most interesting point was how all these coding languages emerged and how you can signify the same thing even if its in a different language. Learning really is limitless.
</p>



<h3>
Interesting things you have found about the history of the web
</h3>

<p>
It hasn't been around for as long as I thought. The way that these frameworks and theories were realized is actually unimaginable. I'm surprised at how many iterations took place while forming what we know to be the internet today. The fact that the World Wide Web was established just about 30 years ago is baffling to be because of how much it has changed following its inception.
</p>


<h3>
Your goals for this course
</h3>

<p>
Pass, obviously

To create my first website
To be fluent in different coding languages 
Experiment with different styles and aesthetics that create visually compelling websites
Better understand what the internet is

    <h3> Reflection on readings</h3>
    
     <p>
        The 2003 book "You Say You Want a Revolution?" by Stuart Moulthrop examines how hypertext was intended to alter how we communicate, write, and read.  He questions if hypertext has actually brought forth a revolution or if it has only produced a new kind of control by applying Marshall McLuhan's media theory.  Hypertext was first envisioned as a democratic, open system that permitted users to freely interact and produce information.  But Moulthrop contends that rather than a digital haven we were left with corporately run websites like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.  These businesses control what information is displayed, influencing what individuals read and think.
    
        <br/>
    
        In his discussion on surveillance, Moulthrop makes the prediction that hypertext might be used as a tool for user tracking.  Large volumes of data are being gathered by businesses and governments from internet purchases, social media, and search engines. "Do you accept these cookies?”. The internet frequently serves to uphold established power systems rather than to empower individuals.  For instance, social media algorithms restrict true freedom of expression by promoting some information while concealing others.
        
        <br/>
    
        The fact that media revolutions frequently reproduce the past is another important argument.  Before it was taken over by large corporations, television appeared to be a democratic medium.  Similar circumstances applied to the internet, which began as an open platform in the 1990s but is currently controlled by a small number of strong corporations.  The basic idea of hypertext is still being pursued, nevertheless, by certain initiatives like Wikipedia and open-source initiatives.
        
        <br/>
    
        Moulthrop's essay serves as a reminder that a revolution cannot be sparked by technology alone.  The way people utilise and manage digital tools determines real change.  He encourages us to consider whether we have already lost control or whether we can still fight for an open internet.  His theories are still very applicable as we traverse the online world of today, when knowledge and power are more intertwined than ever.

        <h3>Reflection on interaction and the WWW</h3>

        <p>
            Human communication is built on interaction, which also shapes how we connect, learn, and exchange ideas.  The World Wide Web (WWW) has changed interaction in the digital age from a local, in-person encounter to a worldwide, instantaneous information exchange.  I define interaction as meaningful participation, teamwork, and communication rather than merely liking articles or clicking links. <br>

           <br> Interaction has become more dynamic because to the web, which enables users to contribute to conversations, produce material, and influence online environments.  We now have more avenues to express ourselves and change the world thanks to social media, forums, and online gaming groups.  But not every interaction is created equal.  Some voices are magnified while others are buried due to the rise of algorithms and monetised engagement, which shapes our perspectives in ways we may not always be aware of. <br>

           <br>I believe that critical thought and active engagement are necessary for true interaction.  It involves more than just taking in knowledge; it also involves asking questions, coming up with ideas, and participating.  Initially, the web was an open hypertext system that allowed users to freely link and explore concepts.  However, a large portion of our interactions now take place on regulated platforms where businesses control what we can see and how we can participate. <br>

            <br>This begs the crucial question: Are we actually interacting, or are we merely responding to the information that is presented to us?  Are we influenced by covert systems or do we have agency over our digital environments?  We must reconsider what meaningful engagement looks like as the web develops and how we might preserve true human connection in a society that is becoming more and more influenced by technology. <br>

    <h2>User Alignment</h2>

    <p>
In web design, user alignment refers to how the design of your website aligns with the user's expectations, experience, needs and behaviours when interacting with a website.  My user alignment aims to consider elements that are placed in a format that is intuitive to the user. <br>


<br> The ways I intend to do this is to prioritise user-centered design to improve usability and engagement. To do this, establishing a consistent structure that focuses on readability, simplicity and interactivity in order to create a seamless experience that will keep the user engaged. </br>

<br> Content:
<ul><b>
    <li> Homepage</li>
    <li> Blogs</li>
    <li> Portfolio</li>
    <li> Profile</li>
    <li> Essays</li>

</b>
</ul>

The user interface aims to convey a simplistic design that is accessible and responsive. Any and all screen readers (desktop, phone, tablet) should be able to engage with the website content, emulating similar if not the same experience across platforms. I aim to utilise other semantic languages such as Javascript and CSS once I have establish a front-end scheme that satisfies the requirements of a working design.<br>

<br> Javascript and CSS as mentioned above work as back-end semantic languages that aid in the visual formatting and layout placement in web design and primarily focus on bridging the gap between the user and the system.
    </p>

<h3> URL Scheme and Semantic Markup</h3>

<p>
    The use of HTML (or other markup languages) that communicates the meaning of content instead of primarily specifying how it is presented is known as semantic markup. <br>
    It aids in the comprehension of the content's structure and intent by screen readers, search engines, and other technologies. <br>
    <br>

    <img
    class="u-photo" src="../images/URL Scheme.png" alt="URL Scheme" title="URL Scheme"/>
<br> Better understanding the <b>folder structure</b> allows for my content to be structured in a way that aligns with how I want my URL Scheme and Sematic Markup to function.
</p>

<h3> Development progress</h3>

<p>
    The have been updated my website weekly to ensure that I am up to date. I have noticed that regularly updating my website allows me time to familiarise myself with the semantic elements and web design. There are many small considerations that one has to make when design the user interface and user experience. <br>
    Many attributes of design may seem intuitive at first, but when applying these principals into a practical example I realised things like navigation and structure or interaction and engagement matter just as much as the aesthetics. I have therefore been focusing on learning the semantic HTML elements to better structure and understand the purpose of my content.
