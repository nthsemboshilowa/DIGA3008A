            <h2>Closing the gap — An analysis of Tataki and Glynos - 2020 - Digital Divide Widens</h2>
            
            <div>

<p>

<p>
    The reading explores the global affects of the "digital divide", defined by global technological disparity observed in a social and economic context.
</p>


<p>
    Tataki and Glynos (2020) demonstrate how the pandemic accelerated digital dependence, yet access remained unequal, reinforcing systemic disadvantages. However, their analysis, while compelling, overlooks a critical dimension: digitalization is often discussed as an inevitable, universally beneficial force when in reality, its rollout frequently ignores the needs of marginalized groups. True digital equality requires more than just infrastructure—intentional design, policy, and education that centre the most excluded.
</p>

 
<p>
    The authors rightly highlight how e-learning and remote work excluded millions, particularly in low-income regions and among disadvantaged demographics. Yet, their focus on access alone is insufficient. Even if devices and internet connections were universally available, disparities would persist without digital literacy programs, culturally relevant content, and affordability guarantees. For instance, rural communities—already suffering from the "rural penalty" (Daniolou, 2020)—may gain little from broadband if platforms are not available in local languages or if data costs remain prohibitive. This suggests that digital inclusion must be context-specific, addressing connectivity and usability.
</p>

 <p>
    Moreover, the assumption that digitalization inherently benefits all must be challenged. While Tataki and Glynos note that teleworking favoured high-income earners, they do not question whether the digital economy itself perpetuates inequality. Gig platforms, for example, often exploit low-wage workers under the guise of flexibility. Similarly, AI-driven hiring tools can encode bias, further marginalizing minorities. Thus, digital equality requires not just access but regulation—ensuring technology serves equity rather than exacerbating it.
 </p>

 

<p>
    Daniolou’s argument that broadband can integrate rural economies into global markets is valid, but it risks romanticizing connectivity without addressing power imbalances. Rural artisans may gain online visibility, but without fair trade mechanisms, global intermediaries could still underpay them. Digital inclusion, then, must be paired with economic justice measures, such as cooperative platform models or localized digital marketplaces that prioritize community ownership.
</p>

 

To conclude, the readings expose the digital divide’s consequences but stop short of demanding structural change. Bridging the gap requires more than short-term fixes like laptop loans or free data—it demands rethinking digitalization as a collective good. Policies should mandate affordable internet as a public utility, fund localized digital literacy initiatives and regulate tech to prevent exploitation. Otherwise, the digital revolution will remain a privilege, not a right. The divide is not just about who has technology, but who controls it—and who benefits.
