<h3>
    Your experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages
</h3>

<p>
    I am familiar with the GitHub interface and know my way around most of the features but it was my first time publishing to Pages. It was a lot easier than I anticipated. Although we've just started, I'm excited to develop this website and see what happens in this course.

        Reflection on the readings you selected - relating it to your experience with the internet today
    </h3>


<p>
    Harper - 2010 - 'As We May Think' 

    After reading this article, I better understand the internet as being a digitalized mind. The structures and framework in which these systems are developed are like an person's mind; while the internet acts like a hive mind intended to link all the intersection that take place. We can observed many similarities between the how our own minds work and how the internet works; blurring the lines between reality and pixels.
    
    There really is more to it than meets the eye, which makes learning about intimidating and overwhelming. The most interesting point was how all these coding languages emerged and how you can signify the same thing even if its in a different language. Learning really is limitless.

<h3>
    Interesting things you have found about the history of the web
</h3>

<p>
    It hasn't been around for as long as I thought. The way that these frameworks and theories were realized is actually unimaginable. I'm surprised at how many iterations took place while forming what we know to be the internet today. The fact that the World Wide Web was established just about 30 years ago is baffling to be because of how much it has changed following its inception.
