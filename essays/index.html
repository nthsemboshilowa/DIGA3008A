    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    

<p> User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are essential in how people interact with digital platforms. In South Africa, where there are many languages, social differences, and limited access to technology, UI/UX design must consider the local context. This essay critically examines Uber’s UI/UX design in South Africa and explores its ethical strengths and weaknesses. It draws on frameworks by Ghanchi (2021), Shapochka (2025), GeeksforGeeks (2022), and Chivukula et al. (2020). This essay will evaluate topics that mention accessibility, inclusivity, privacy, bias, emergency design, and the ethical role of designers.</p>
<br>

<h4> Uber’s Global UI and Local Challenges</h4>
<p>Uber uses the same UI design around the world. It has a simple layout with features like real-time tracking and one-click ride booking. This global consistency helps users who are already familiar with the app. However, in South Africa, this globalized uniformity introduces challenges of cultural and linguistic inclusivity. The app uses only English, even though South Africa has 11 official languages. This limits access for users who do not speak English well, especially in rural areas (Ghanchi, 2021).
In order for UX to be considered ‘good’, it must respond to the user’s environment (Chivukula et al., 2020). Uber’s design does not consider local conditions such as poor internet coverage or low digital literacy. For example, users in low-income areas may not have stable mobile networks, making it hard to use the app. The design assumes users have constant access to data and GPS, which is not always true in South Africa. In another instance, Uber’s South African design lacks context-specific adaptations. For instance, in areas with high crime rates, users often feel unsafe waiting outdoors. Uber has attempted to mitigate this with features like “Share My Trip” and in-app emergency buttons. However, users report inconsistent responses from authorities and drivers when emergencies occur—pointing to a disconnect between UI design and real-world UX outcomes.</p>

<h4>Accessibility and Inclusion</h4>
Accessibility is a basic part of ethical UX design. Uber’s app has very few features for people with disabilities. There is limited voice support and no clear optimisation for screen readers or haptic feedback. In a country where many people may have physical or educational limitations, notably the elderly, this makes the app harder to use. 
As Shapochka (2025) explains, ethical UX must “think for the user” in difficult situations. If someone has poor vision or cannot read quickly, they should still be able to use the app easily. Uber’s design shows little effort to support users with different needs. Ghanchi (2021) argues that design must reflect care for all users, not just those who are tech-savvy or wealthy.


<h4>Privacy and Consent</h4>
Uber collects large amounts of user data, such as locations, payment methods, and travel history. Although users agree to this when using the app, the privacy policy is written in complex legal language. This makes it difficult for people with lower education levels to fully understand what they are agreeing to (GeeksforGeeks, 2022).
Chivukula et al. (2020) highlight that users must have control over their data. Ethical design should give users clear choices about what information is shared and for how long. Uber’s app in South Africa does not offer enough simple options for changing data settings. As a result, many users may be sharing more than they realise, without fully informed consent.

<h4>Bias in Algorithmic Design</h4>
Uber’s system uses algorithms to decide prices and match riders with drivers. While this helps the service run smoothly, it can also create bias. In South Africa, people living in poorer or mostly Black areas often report longer wait times and higher prices. This could be the result of an algorithm that favours areas with more drivers or higher fares, even if it is not intentional (Ghanchi, 2021).
Ethical UX design should include checks to prevent such unfair outcomes. Chivukula et al. (2020) state that designers have a duty to consider how their systems might hurt certain groups. In Uber’s case, not checking the algorithm for bias means the system could continue to disadvantage already-marginalised users.

<h4>Emergency Features and Crisis Design</h4>
South Africa has high crime rates in many cities. This makes safety an important part of ride-hailing apps. Uber includes some safety tools like emergency buttons and live location sharing. However, many users have reported that these features do not always work well. Sometimes emergency services respond slowly, or drivers ignore the alerts (Shapochka, 2025).
In a crisis, users may not have time to figure out how to use complex features. Ethical UX should make safety tools easy to find and use under stress. Uber could improve by adding clearer alerts, offline safety options, or automatic help messages. According to Shapochka (2025), ethical crisis design means making the right action the easiest one to take.

<h4>Dark Patterns and User Manipulation</h4>
Uber’s app uses persuasive design techniques to encourage users to choose more expensive ride types, such as Uber Comfort or Uber XL. These options are made more visible, while cheaper ones are less obvious. This is a type of “dark pattern” known as visual manipulation (GeeksforGeeks, 2022).
While some level of persuasion is acceptable in design, users should not be tricked into spending more than they want. Chivukula et al. (2020) warn that designers must balance business goals with user rights. Uber’s current design gives users less control by hiding lower-cost options. A more ethical solution would be to show all choices equally and let users set their ride preferences.

<h4>Usability and Feedback</h4>
A key part of ethical UX is giving users feedback during every step of their journey. Uber usually performs well with real-time tracking and driver updates. But during busy times or when there are network issues, the app can stop working or freeze without explanation. This leaves users confused and frustrated (Ghanchi, 2021).
Chivukula et al. (2020) argue that ethical design includes respect for the user’s time and mental effort. Uber could improve by adding simple messages like “retry” buttons, progress bars, or support pop-ups. These small features can reduce anxiety and improve trust in the service.

<h4>Connectivity Issues and Offline Use</h4>
South Africa’s internet and mobile networks are not reliable in all areas. Uber’s app needs a live data connection to work, which limits its use in rural or low-income places. There are no options for booking rides through SMS or using offline maps.
Shapochka (2025) says that ethical design must work even in weak infrastructure. Uber could offer features like offline booking for recent routes, SMS ride confirmation, or a low-data mode. These changes would make the app more inclusive for users without strong or regular internet access.

<h4>Cultural Sensitivity and Localisation</h4>
Uber’s interface looks the same in every country. It does not reflect South African languages, holidays, or cultural habits. For example, the app does not offer promotions for public holidays or use local phrases. This makes the platform feel distant and foreign.
Chivukula et al. (2020) use the term “design citizenship” to explain how apps should reflect local values. A more ethical UI in South Africa would include language options, local events, and regional slang. These features would make users feel seen and respected, not just included as an afterthought.

<br>

<h4>The Designer’s Ethical Role</h4>
Behind every app is a team of designers making decisions. These designers must balance company profits with user needs. Chivukula et al. (2020) describe this as “ethical mediation”—finding a middle ground between business goals and doing what is right for users.
Uber’s current design shows that business priorities often come first. Many ethical problems—like lack of accessibility, weak privacy controls, and cultural blindness—could be fixed if designers pushed for them. Ghanchi (2021) reminds us that being a good designer means thinking about how design affects people’s lives, especially in vulnerable communities.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
Uber’s UI/UX in South Africa shows both strengths and ethical weaknesses. The app is functional and easy to use for many people, but it often ignores the needs of users in rural, low-income, or marginalised areas. It lacks accessibility, privacy clarity, emergency support, and cultural sensitivity. These are not just technical problems—they are ethical ones.
Using the work of Ghanchi (2021), Shapochka (2025), GeeksforGeeks (2022), and Chivukula et al. (2020), this essay has shown that ethical design means more than just a working interface. It means respecting users' dignity, choices, and safety. Designers must take responsibility for the outcomes of their work. In places like South Africa, where digital access is uneven and the risks are higher, ethical UX is not just important—it is essential.

    <h4>Iteration 1</h4>

Introduction

The internet, once envisioned as a borderless space of freedom and democratization, has increasingly become a domain structured by geopolitical forces and infrastructural inequalities. Far from being a neutral platform, digital connectivity is shaped by who owns the infrastructure, who governs access, and under what conditions data and communications are allowed to circulate. The 2024 case involving Elon Musk’s Starlink offer to provide satellite internet access to Gaza starkly illustrates these dynamics. This essay critically examines the Starlink-Gaza controversy through the lens of digital colonialism, drawing on the theoretical frameworks of Couldry and Mejias (2019) and Greenstein et al. (2018). It argues that the episode exemplifies how private digital infrastructure replicates imperial power relations, undermines digital sovereignty, and reinforces existing territorial control mechanisms under the guise of connectivity.

The Starlink Controversy: Chronology and Response

During the late months of 2023, as the Israeli military intensified airstrikes in Gaza, the enclave experienced repeated communication blackouts. These interruptions cut off humanitarian aid workers, journalists, and civilians from the outside world, complicating both relief coordination and international awareness of events on the ground. In response, Elon Musk announced via Twitter/X in October 2023 that SpaceX’s Starlink would provide satellite internet “support to internationally recognized aid groups” operating in Gaza. This announcement was followed by public condemnation from Israeli Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi, who stated that Israel would not permit such service without its express approval. Subsequently, Musk clarified that Starlink operations would proceed only with coordination from both the Israeli and U.S. governments (New York Times, 2024).

This sequence of events is notable not simply for what it reveals about Musk’s corporate diplomacy, but for what it exposes about the architecture of digital access in conflict zones. In a moment of humanitarian urgency, digital connectivity was not governed by the needs of those most affected—Palestinians in Gaza—but by the geopolitical interests of state and corporate actors external to them. This reality underpins the argument that the internet, despite its emancipatory rhetoric, remains a tool shaped and wielded by dominant global powers.

Digital Colonialism and Conditional Connectivity

Couldry and Mejias (2019) argue that the expansion of digital infrastructure by powerful Western corporations into marginalised regions represents a continuation of colonial practices through data and technological control. In their formulation of “data colonialism,” digital systems are not merely commercial platforms, but instruments of extraction, governance, and domination. Just as classical colonialism involved the appropriation of land, labour, and resources, digital colonialism extracts data, controls access to communication and imposes external systems of value and control over populations.

Musk’s Starlink offer, positioned as a humanitarian intervention, is best understood within this framework. Although it purported to restore internet access in a besieged territory, it did so on the condition that the occupying and allied powers gave their approval. The population most in need of connectivity had no say in the matter. Starlink’s satellites, despite their ostensible independence from terrestrial politics, were thus embedded in the geopolitical hierarchy that sustains Gaza’s isolation. As Couldry and Mejias (2019) argue, such digital interventions are not apolitical; they reproduce the logics of colonial power through technological means, bypassing or even hollowing out national and subnational sovereignty.

Infrastructural Imperialism and the Illusion of Technological Neutrality

The Gaza case also underscores what media scholar Lisa Parks describes as “infrastructural imperialism”—the imposition of external technical systems that reshape the sovereignty and autonomy of local spaces (as cited in Couldry & Mejias, 2019). Starlink’s offer to connect Gaza with satellite internet was not a neutral act of technological aid. It was a political decision with implications for jurisdiction, surveillance, and control. The infrastructure was not being offered to Palestinian authorities or civil society actors, but to “internationally recognized” (read: Western-approved) humanitarian organisations, and even then, only with Israeli and U.S. approval.

This dynamic reflects a broader pattern in which Western tech companies act as de facto geopolitical agents. By controlling the levers of access, companies like SpaceX participate in the construction of digital borders, determining who gets to speak, when, and under what terms. These borders do not always align with the physical geography of the state; rather, they map onto zones of control, alliance, and economic interest. The result is a layered form of imperialism—territorial, infrastructural, and discursive—all consolidated within a digital framework.

Geography, the Internet, and Uneven Access

Greenstein et al. (2018) provide a crucial economic geography lens to understand this case. They argue that the internet, rather than erasing geographic inequalities, often exacerbates them due to uneven access to complementary resources—such as skilled labour, broadband infrastructure, and regulatory environments. The authors identify three economic frictions that the internet reduces: communication costs, transportation costs, and search costs. Yet, these reductions do not benefit all locations equally. Instead, their impact is mediated by local conditions such as institutional stability, market readiness, and physical infrastructure.

Gaza exemplifies a location where such frictions remain deeply entrenched. The region suffers from a chronic lack of physical and digital infrastructure due to blockade, conflict, and political fragmentation. Even if Starlink satellites were to cover Gaza's airspace, without supportive local infrastructure or sovereign authority, the net benefit of that connectivity would remain minimal or selectively applied. Greenstein et al. (2018) further highlight that internet investments yield the highest returns in places already well-integrated into global economies. Thus, the Starlink case reveals how technological fixes for connectivity can fail when they ignore—or worse, entrench—the structural barriers that define spatial inequality.

Digital Sovereignty and the Politics of Permission
At the heart of this controversy is the question of digital sovereignty. Who has the right to control the digital flows within a particular territory? In Gaza’s case, the answer was made clear: not the people living there. Starlink, a U.S.-based private company, subordinated its decision to state actors aligned with Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory. This refusal to operate without Israeli and U.S. approval underscores how digital infrastructure is not truly transnational, but rather embedded in national security apparatuses and aligned with dominant political interests.

This scenario illustrates a key point made by Couldry and Mejias (2019): under digital colonialism, sovereignty is not exercised by the people over their data and communications, but by foreign entities who dictate the terms of access. This not only mirrors classical colonialism but updates it for the information age. Connectivity becomes a tool of discipline—a privilege to be granted or revoked based on compliance with geopolitical expectations.

Connectivity Without Liberation
Critically, connectivity alone does not equate to empowerment. Even in moments where Palestinians in Gaza have access to internet platforms, their digital voice is often muted through algorithmic suppression, platform bias, or content moderation policies that disproportionately affect Arabic-language users (though not directly discussed here due to source limitations). Starlink may have offered bandwidth, but it did not guarantee narrative agency. This reinforces the critique that digital infrastructure, when controlled externally, can provide the appearance of inclusion while maintaining systemic marginalisation.

Conclusion

The Starlink-Gaza episode is not simply a case of delayed internet access; it is a clear manifestation of how digital infrastructures are entwined with global power. The offer of connectivity was subject to the permission of dominant states, executed by a private corporation, and directed toward Western-approved organisations—not the people of Gaza themselves. Far from being a neutral tool of humanitarian assistance, Starlink became a mechanism through which geopolitical power and digital colonialism were enacted.
As Greenstein et al. (2018) remind us, geography still matters. The material realities of place—who governs it, who occupies it, and who is excluded from global systems—continue to shape the internet’s effects. The notion of a borderless digital space collapses when confronted with the political economies of access. Meanwhile, as Couldry and Mejias (2019) contend, the dream of universal connectivity must be tempered by a recognition that data and infrastructure are new frontiers of imperial control. Without a rethinking of digital sovereignty, justice, and autonomy, the internet will not be a tool for liberation, but a weapon of empire.

    <h4>Iteration 1</h4>

    Reflection

Folder Structure

My folder structure mostly reflects the hierarchical organization of my content. I separated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into their own files and folders, which helps keep concerns separated between structure, presentation, and logic. This made it easier to manage each part individually. However, it’s only somewhat modular—I think my naming conventions could be more consistent and better thought out to support scalability in the future.
Semantic Markup
I didn’t fully implement semantic markup the way I should have. Basic structure was there, but I missed out on using proper tags like <main>, <article>, <aside>, and ARIA roles where needed. Because of this, the browser and assistive technologies might not fully understand the content or navigation. Time constraints also meant I couldn’t fully express my content the way I intended. Semantic markup would have helped with both accessibility and SEO, so I know that’s something to work on more intentionally next time.
Metadata

I included some metadata like <title> and basic <meta> tags, but not enough to fully guide how the browser interprets the page. I did identify which parts needed metadata (like viewport, language, and description), but I didn’t express them all properly. This weakens the site’s performance in terms of responsiveness and search engine visibility.

CSS

I kept styling consistent by avoiding inline styles and using an external CSS file. This made everything cleaner and easier to update. I also started working with responsive design principles, using media queries and flexible layouts, but there’s more to improve there. My CSS is modular to an extent, but I could organize and comment it better to make it fully maintainable—especially if more pages were added.

JavaScript & APIs

This was the biggest challenge for me. I struggled a lot with implementing JavaScript in a meaningful way. I understood basic concepts like variables and functions, but when it came to DOM manipulation and event handling, I wasn’t confident. The biggest issue was working with APIs—I wasn't sure how to connect to one properly, or how to use the data once I had it. I tried to follow tutorials and examples, but often didn’t fully understand what each line was doing. I’m still not sure if what I did works as expected or follows best practices. This is definitely something I need to revisit and spend more time on. I want to get more comfortable with making async requests and handling data dynamically, but right now it still feels confusing and overwhelming.


Personal Expression & Time Limitations

One of my biggest regrets is not being able to make the website feel more personal. I had so many ideas—visual elements, colour choices, interactive pieces, even animations—that would have helped the site reflect my personality. But time really caught up with me. I focused so much on getting the structure and basic functionality in place that I couldn’t experiment or polish the creative parts. I wish I could have added more expressive touches to show who I am, not just what I learned technically. Hopefully, I’ll have time after this to keep building on it and really make it mine.
